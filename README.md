# One Million Row Demo

A high-performance demo that showcases how to load and interact with over 1 million rows of data from an external source using modern tools.

This project uses:

- **[LyteNyte Grid](https://www.1771technologies.com/demo)** â€“ Lightning-fast grid for large data sets.
- **SQLite** â€“ Lightweight, embedded database.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** â€“ Next-generation frontend tooling.
- **[Hono](https://hono.dev/)** â€“ Ultra-lightweight, fast backend framework.
